h1. pfile-tools: GE P-File Utilities

This package provides a library refrence to GE's proprietary P-file format for their MR scanners. This is not a translation of their copyrighted header files, but a re-implementation. It's designed to let you catalog and anonymize your raw data, and hopefully provide enough information to run your own reconstruction.

In addition to the library, pfile-tools provides small scripts to display pfile header values and do an anomymization.

h2. Status

Header support is limited to stuff we've needed in-house or stuff that's really obvious. If you need something added, let me know.

Also, we currently only support reading revision 20 of the files. I suspect that it'll also effectively work on other revisions, but I don't know for sure which. Let me know!

h2. Installation

For now, it's:

<pre>
  $ git clone https://github.com/njvack/pfile-tools.git
  $ cd pfile-tools
  $ python setup.py install
</pre>

Installation via easy_install and pip is coming.

h2. API Usage

<pre>
  >>> from pfile_tools import headers
  >>> pfile = headers.Pfile.from_file('/path/to/PXXXX.7')
  >>> print(pfile.revision)
  20
  >>> print(pfile.header.exam_number)
  5313
  >>> print(pfile.header.exam_datetime)
  datetime(2012, 3, 6, 10, 47, 42)
</pre>

Pfile.header is a Python "ctypes Structure":http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure.

h2. dump_pfile_header

Does what it says on the tin -- dumps a p-file's header to standard out, in a delimited (by default, tab-delimited) format.
